# Oct-2019-Python-Training-Minicourse
A three-hour training course for beginner programmers

# Installing Python
navigate to: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

select operating system

download python 3.7 graphical installer

follow the instructions; skip the installation of the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You can try this later. We will be using the Spyder IDE instead for this class.

# Notes from the class
During the class, there was a question about why sets don't show up in the Spyder Variable Explorer.
I don't know the answer! I googled it and found this slightly related post: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/2355

I think my answer to this one is that, while I and many others have found Python and the Spyder IDE to be excellent and reliable tools, they are not perfect, and are both constantly in development by the open source community. As I mentioned, being open source and not associated with a company is both a blessing and a curse, and this small issue is possibly an example of that.
